            phase is designed to guide you step by step through a training
            visualization, helping you become familiar with how this type of
            graph works. At each step, you may be asked to complete a short quiz
            on the monitor to check your understanding.

            visualization.

            may keep and refer to the sheet at any time during the experiment.

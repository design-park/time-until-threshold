            Version 1: The purpose of this research is to investigate how
            different ways of visualizing climate change data affect people's
            perception of its urgency and their willingness to take action.
            Specifically, we are exploring if animating temperature projections
            on a line graph can reduce the feeling that climate change is a
            distant problem, thereby increasing your willingness to engage in
            mitigation behaviors.
          </p>

          <p className="subText">
            Version 2: The purpose of this research is to investigate how
            different visual representations of climate change data influence
            public understanding and engagement with the issue.

          <h4 className="titleText">What is expected from you:</h4>
          <p className="subText">
            The experiment is expected to last approximately 25 minutes. You
            will be seated at a computer with a screen and keyboard. You can
            proceed with what the computer prompts you to do. It will include
            answering questionnaires, reading, and interacting with the
            visualization. For the reading, you would be provided with the
            material on paper. When prompted by the computer, please ask the
            researcher for the paper material. Your responses throughout the
            study will be recorded.

            The data obtained will be treated with the utmost confidentiality.
            Your identity will be masked using a random number (participant
            code), and no other information will reveal it. Only the principal
            investigator and supervisors will have access; you may request their
            destruction at any time by providing the participant code listed on
            the consent form.

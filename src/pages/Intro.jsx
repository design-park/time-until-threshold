      <h4 className="titleText">Purpose of the research project:</h4>
      <p className="subText">
        Version 1: The purpose of this research is to investigate how different
        ways of visualizing climate change data affect people's perception of
        its urgency and their willingness to take action. Specifically, we are
        exploring if animating temperature projections on a line graph can
        reduce the feeling that climate change is a distant problem, thereby
        increasing your willingness to engage in mitigation behaviors.
      </p>

      <p className="subText">
        Version 2: The purpose of this research is to investigate how different
        visual representations of climate change data influence public
        understanding and engagement with the issue.
      </p>

      <h4 className="titleText">What is expected from you:</h4>
      <p className="subText">
        The experiment is expected to last approximately 25 minutes. You will be
        seated at a computer with a screen and keyboard. You can proceed with
        what the computer prompts you to do. It will include answering
        questionnaires, reading, and interacting with the visualization. For the
        reading, you would be provided with the material on paper. When prompted
        by the computer, please ask the researcher for the paper material. Your
        responses throughout the study will be recorded.

        The data obtained will be treated with the utmost confidentiality. Your
        identity will be masked using a random number (participant code), and no
        other information will reveal it. Only the principal investigator and
        supervisors will have access; you may request their destruction at any
        time by providing the participant code listed on the consent form.

      <h4 className="titleText">Benefits of the study:</h4>
      <p className="subText">
        You may become more informed about the issue of climate change and its
        potential impacts.

      <h4 className="titleText">Possible risks of the study:</h4>
      <p className="subText">
        While there are no anticipated physical risks, some participants may
        experience temporary feelings of anxiety or concern when engaging with
        information about climate change projections.
